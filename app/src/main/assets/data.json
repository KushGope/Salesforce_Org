A new team is going to take over prep&#39;ing them for issue and they&#39;ve complained about the experience of getting from the OOB firmware (Android 12) to the latest.

    "Description__c": "<p>Hello!</p><p><br></p><p>We have an application where we can disable firmware updates over the air using RestrictionPolicy.allowOTAUpgrade(). When the application disables firmware updates, all menus under &quot;software update&quot; in settings get disabled, as expected. However, the switch preference &quot;Download updates automatically&quot; keeps the state it had before firmware updates were disabled as discussed in ticket <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">TM1750HY</span>. That is, if it was enabled before it is still in enabled state even though the menu is disabled and one might think the device will check for updates automatically.</p><p><br></p><p>The response from R&amp;D last time was that this was the desired behavior since the value set by the user should be maintained and that the FOTA client blocks the FOTA operation, i.e. the device does not look for software updates automatically. (Note that we still consider this as undesired behavior since it causes confusion for the user. The device should still be able to keep/remember the user setting but only show the current setting which is &quot;disabled&quot;.)</p><p><br></p><p>However, we have noticed that it seems like the FOTA client does not block checking for software updates automatically and nags to the user that there are software updates available. The dialog box that pops up states </p><p>&quot;Software update</p><p>Software updates are controlled by your organization Contact the IT-administrator to get more information.&quot;. </p><p>Note, it is not possible to install any software.</p><p><br></p><p>This is how we have investigated the issue.</p><p>1) We started to see the dialog box about software updates described above almost once a day for the device</p><p>2) We enabled firmware updates and saw there was actually a security patch available for download</p><p>3) We downloaded the software update, but did not install it</p><p>4) We disabled firmware updates and pressed install on the downloaded software update</p><p>5) We were not allowed to install the update (as expected) and the downloaded software was probably removed (we could not press install or anything again)</p><p>6) After almost a day, we started to get notifications of software updates again even though FOTA was disabled by our application</p><p><br></p><p>We have also tested this for S10E model where we do not get any nagging of software updates when FOTA is disabled, even though the switch preference to download automatically over WiFi is enabled.</p><p><br></p><p>We want all FOTA functionality to be disabled when we disallow software updates, including checking for updates. Can you confirm that this issue only causes the user to experience nagging popups? Or is there any more FOTA functionality still operational when disallowing software updates?</p><p><br></p><p>Furthermore, is there any workaround for the issue on the A3 2017 device? Which other device models can we expect to have the same issue?</p><p><br></p><p>Kind Regards</p><p>Fredrik Waern</p>",

If that feature is depricated, i would expect it being removed from factory menu. Given it’s there and can be set, I expect it to work. <p> </p>So, this bug is taking away our last option to push a bridge firmware to the TVs without waiting for TVs to powercycle with human interaction. (As we can send commands to the frontend, which control the tv and powers off/on the tv like the remote handset would do)<p> </p>Please let me know, when we can expect a fix for the “reboot when going to virt. Standby” feature, and in which firmware versions  this will be merged. We don’t want to update TVs multiple times.<p></p>",

In the “Assign devices and Firmware” section the A50 was set to “Lock current firmware”.</p><p>When I changed the setting to “Select from Firmware List” there was no firmware present and had to wait for the firmware list sync to complete so I let that run while I attended to another task. Upon returning 5 mins later my inbox was bombarded with KNOX E-FOTA emails to advise me the firmware sync completed. I received just under 20 emails to advise me of this (see attached zip file of all the email notifications). My work colleagues who are admins in KNOX E-FOTA also received these spam emails. Those emails stopped once I selected a firmware version for that A50 device. </p><p><br></p><p>Would like to know why there is a need to constantly notify all admins that the firmware sync completed and is there a need to constantly send 2-3 emails every minute to advise that the sync has completed? I think one email notification would suffice.</p><p><br></p><p>The Knox E-FOTA One Admin Guide does state that when the firmware sync is completed you will receive an email notification however in my case it is more like you will keep receiving email notifications until the firmware version is selected.</p><p><br></p><p>Would like to know if only 1 email can be sent to advise the firmware sync has completed.

A9 -&gt; A10 -&gt; A11) or is it possible to start patching at the latest level (eg. A9 -&gt; A11, skipping patching of A10)</p><p><br></p><p>2) If patching directly to the latest level is possible, does this mean it will patch all the data between A9 to A11 (eg. A10 data + A11 data), or it will just patch (A11 data without needing to patch A10 data)</p><p><br></p><p>3) Related to above question, when scheduling a campaign in KEONE on premise, it is only possible to schedule campaigns for the latest firmware, does this mean it is not possible to schedule campaigns to patch a slightly older firmware instead of the latest one</p><p><br></p><p>Appreciate the advice</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you</p>",

If tablets with that build were turned off for a longer period, it is impossible for them to start again as they seem to be stuck at the start of the system boot. According to your colleagues (ticket no. 00193628), the issue is firmware-related and can be fixed with a new firmware. Due to the pandemic, many affected tablets are out of warranty but could probably be fixed by our team. For this, we would need a correct firmware to deploy within the still-working ODIN mode (safe mode doesn&#39;t work, so this kind of reset is no solution). Can you please provide us with a solution? This would also be helpful for Samsung as we and our partner EGISS are currently sending in all software-damaged devices that are still covered by warranty.</p><p><br></p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Haris Trgo</p>",

Below are the detailed observations and steps taken:<p> </p>Title of the issue:<p></p>Issue with Reach Channel List Setup After Firmware Update<p> </p>Description of the issue:<p></p>Our partner has been experiencing an ongoing issue with 63 HTVs (model HG65EJ690U) installed in a motel. After a firmware update in May 2024, necessitated by previous problems with Samsung Reach, the &#39;Cable&#39; option disappeared from the channel tuning menu. As a result, it is no longer possible to sort the TV channels. Despite multiple attempts following provided troubleshooting steps, the issue persists. The Reach version currently installed is up-to-date (4.1 1601).<p> </p>What troubleshoots we have tried:<p> </p>Verified the Room Number and Group ID settings in the REACH Solution menu.<p></p>Confirmed firmware update to version 1400.<p></p>Attempted channel setup verification and auto-tuning with &#39;Cable&#39; as the aerial type.<p></p>Reinstalled the provided firmware version shared by the support team.<p></p>Reviewed the sorting options in the &#39;Edit Channel List&#39; menu, confirming they are missing.<p></p>Checked and confirmed the TV configuration via screenshots provided by the customer.<p></p>Ensured the customer has the most recent Reach version (4.1 1601) installed and operational.<p></p>Asked the customer to ensure the settings persist across all devices after performing recommended steps.<p></p>What is the Expected result:<p></p>The customer should be able to sort channels and have the &#39;Cable&#39; option available in the menu.<p> </p>What is the Actual Result:<p></p>The &#39;Cable&#39; option remains unavailable, and channel sorting is not possible. The issue persists after all troubleshooting steps.<p> </p>Files attached to the case:<p> </p>Screenshots of the TV system and menu options.<p></p>Completed field checklist with all relevant details.<p></p>Thank you in advance for reviewing this case. Please let me know if further details are required or additional steps need to be taken.<p> </p>Looking forward to your guidance on resolving this issue.<p> </p>Best regards,<p></p>Biser Raikov<p></p>Samsung Electronics B2B Support Hub Team<p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p>",

I&#39;d like to bring a case with one of our partners to your attention.<p> </p>Title of the issue:<p></p>WM65B – PDF files cannot be downloaded from specific website after firmware upgrade<p> </p>Description of the issue:<p></p>Our partner Lasercharge has reported an issue with a Samsung Interactive Display WM65B installed at Olympion School. The device was recently serviced due to a motherboard failure. After the replacement, the unit was updated from firmware version 1100.6 to 1110.6 (and later also tested with 1120.3). Since the firmware update, the device cannot download PDF files from the following educational website:<p> </p>https://mathd.schools.ac.cy/index.php/el/yliko/didaktiko-yliko-a-taxi<p> </p>Other WM65B units at the school running firmware 1100.6 do not exhibit this problem and are able to download the same PDFs without issue. This strongly suggests the issue is firmware-related.<p> </p>The device is using the default Samsung Internet browser, and the issue is reproducible only on this specific website. Downloads from other websites (e.g., generic PDF links from unrelated sources) work without any problem. There are no proxy/firewall or filtering rules in place that would selectively block this site, and the behavior has been confirmed in a lab environment by both the partner and our internal team.<p> </p>What troubleshoots we have tried:<p> </p>Confirmed the issue is isolated to a single WM65B device upgraded to firmware 1110.6 and 1120.3.<p></p>Verified that the issue does not occur on other WM65B devices running firmware 1100.6.<p></p>Partner provided a video showing successful PDF download on 1100.6 from the same website.<p></p>Used the default Samsung Internet app on all tests.<p></p>Verified that the screen can successfully download PDFs from other websites, ruling out a general connectivity or browser issue.<p></p>Partner completed the Field Checklist, which is attached.<p></p>Issue has been reproduced internally using WM65B on 1110.6 firmware.<p></p>Expected result:<p></p>User should be able to download PDF documents from the mentioned educational website as with previous firmware.<p> </p>Actual result:<p></p>PDF downloads from this specific website fail or do not complete on firmware versions 1110.6 and 1120.3.<p> </p>Files attached to the case:<p> </p>Field Checklist Excel file (completed by partner)<p></p>Thank you in advance for your support.<p> </p>Kind regards,<p></p>Biser Raikov<p></p>Samsung Electronics B2B Support Hub Team",

    "Description__c": "<p class=\"extension-adhd-reader-p\">Hi, We deploy the knox service plugin with intune on our samsung xcover 5 phones. The problem that has appered in the last 10 days is that when the phones updated to version G525FXXU8CWH1 /G525FOXM8CWH1 / G525FXXU8CWH1 the APN policy that is configured in the knox service plugin does not take effect. i have tested the same setup on a Samsung A52 and the same problem occur. When i use a Samsung xcover 5 or 4s that has not recived that update the policy is applied. i created a configuration with less policies too see if that helped with the APN policy but no change. In the knox service plugin app it says that all policies were successfully completed, but there are no changes. Only the default APN from our service provider appear not our own. The sim cards i am using have all been in use up to this update. i have uploaded the received policies and configuration reports. i hope this will be solved fast because this will effect a large part of our users when the samsung devices updates. If you need anymore information do not hesitate to contact me. </p><p class=\"extension-adhd-reader-p\"><br></p><p class=\"extension-adhd-reader-p\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Sincerely,</span></p><p class=\"extension-adhd-reader-p\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Nicholas</span></p>",

But the customers screen has troubles with the download. Some files will be downloaded, some break all the time so they will not removed from the queue and the download starts over and over again. </p><p><br></p><p>There are two reasons why the download fail:</p><ul><li>File size not correct. We have a simple validation check included. We check the file size on disk with the file size passed by the CMS.</li><li>Common error</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Furthermore, I noticed that the JavaScript player is restarting many times. Like every 30 seconds. And I have not figured out  why this is happening beacuse the log files look good to me.</p><p><br></p><p>I have checked that we have the same model, firmware, OS version (buildVersion of system information) and player version. We both are using the player with a network cable. So to me there are no differences but our customer is not happy with his faulty player</p><p><br></p><p>Can you imagine whats happening here. Are the screens still different?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Christoph</p><p><br></p>",

He can transfer the settings via USB stick normally, but not via Lynk Cloud. Their assumption is in the firmware because the version of the TVs that he can deploy [T-NKLADEUCB-2201.0 (1.3.0621)] extension at the end differs from the firmware version of the TVs that he cannot deploy [T-NKLADEUCB-2201.0 (0.1.4021)].<p> </p>What troubleshoots we have tried: <p></p>1.\tWe have checked the exact model code to be sure we are not mixing with regions or different model code specifics.<p></p>2.\tClone file from the devices which are being able to update from LynkCloud was cloned and tried to be imported via USB on the issued devices, unfortunately the updating process via LynkCloud still not finished.<p> </p><p></p>What is the Expected result: <p> </p><p></p>Being able to update firmware via LynkCloud<p></p>What is the Actual Result: <p> </p>Not able to update firmware from LynkCloud to some of their devices.
